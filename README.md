# Navigation Updater Web

An _extremely_ simplistic spike solution to patch hardcoded Navigation Menu links in the current site to point to a different host name.

Intended to be used until relative URLs (that don't require host names) can be entered for Navigation Menus.

The UI is ugly. If you don't like it: Contribute.
